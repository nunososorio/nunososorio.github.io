<h1>Applications and Technologies in Extended Reality for Surgical Procedures</h1>
<p>Compiled by Nuno S. Osório. Last updated: April 8, 2025</p>
<p><em>The field of surgery has consistently adopted technological innovations to improve precision, safety, and patient outcomes—from antiseptics and minimally invasive techniques to robotics. The latest frontier in this evolution is Extended Reality (XR).</em></p>
<p>This table outlines various uses of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) - collectively known as Extended Reality (XR) - in surgical contexts, drawing information from the provided text and publicly available sources. AR/MR applications focus on intraoperative guidance and planning, while VR is primarily used for training and preparation.</p>
